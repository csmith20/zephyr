      Optional TX & RX dma specifiers.  Each specifier will have a phandle
      reference to the dmac controller, the channel number, and peripheral
      trigger source.

      For example dmas for TX, RX on SERCOM3
         dmas = <&dmac 0 0xb>, <&dmac 0 0xa>;

  dma-names:
    description: |
      Required if the dmas property exists.  This should be "tx" and "rx"
      to match the dmas property.

      For example
         dma-names = "tx", "rx";
